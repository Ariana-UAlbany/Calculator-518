1. git checkout -b "NewBranchName"
2. git pull
3. staging area
4. Intentions:
- got the changes from the remote repository to local repository then switch to a new branch called bugfix/missing-button
- adding button.js to the staging area then committing to the repository with a message to fix missing submit button
- switch to the main branch, then get changes from the main branch, then merge the bugfix branch into the main branch. --no-ff forces a merge commit despite it being a fast forward: this maintains a clear branch record
- sync the changes back to the remote repository
